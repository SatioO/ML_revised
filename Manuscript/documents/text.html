        >Flutter widgets are built using a modern react-style framework, which
        takes inspiration from React. The central idea is that you build your UI
        out of widgets. Widgets describe what their view should look like given
        their current configuration and state. When a widget’s state changes,
        the widget rebuilds its description, which the framework diffs against
        the previous description in order to determine the minimal changes
        needed in the underlying render tree to transition from one state to the
        next.</span
