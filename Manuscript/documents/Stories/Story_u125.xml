				<Content>This document describes the inner workings of the Flutter toolkit that make Flutterâ€™s API possible. Because Flutter widgets are built using aggressive composition, user interfaces built with Flutter have a large number of widgets. To support this workload, Flutter uses sublinear algorithms for layout and building widgets as well as data structures that make tree surgery efficient and that have a number of constant-factor optimizations. With some additional details, this design also makes it easy for developers to create infinite scrolling lists using callbacks that build exactly those widgets that are visible to the user.</Content>
