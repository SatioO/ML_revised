				<Content>The runApp() function takes the given Widget and makes it the root of the widget tree. In this example, the widget tree consists of two widgets, the Center widget and its child, the Text widget. The framework forces the root widget to cover the screen, which means the text “Hello, world” ends up centered on screen. The text direction needs to be specified in this instance; when the MaterialApp widget is used, this is taken care of for you, as demonstrated later.</Content>

				<Content>When writing an app, you’ll commonly author new widgets that are subclasses of either StatelessWidget or StatefulWidget, depending on whether your widget manages any state. A widget’s main job is to implement a build function, which describes the widget in terms of other, lower-level widgets. The framework builds those widgets in turn until the process bottoms out in widgets that represent the underlying RenderObject, which computes and describes the geometry of the widget.</Content>
